## Project Summary
Our project will be implementing an AI to go through a platformer/maze course while utilizing the items in its inventory to succeed. The AI will be given the location it is in of the platformer/maze along with the items in its inventory, and it will take an action to get to the next step of the course (use potion, jump, sprint jump, go left, go right, go back, go forward).
