## Project Summary
We will be using ColosseumRL to study the effect of changing certain paramters (e.g. learning rate) on the success of each policy that we will use. The goal is not only to see which paramter configuration bring the most success but also to see which parameters have the greatest effect on the agent in general. We will use four different machine learning algorithms as the policy for our agents in order to determine the best/most influential parameter configuration per policy, after which we will test which optimized policy gets the best results overall. This research approach will involve training 4 agents to play Blockus. The beginning of the training will involve each of the 4 agents using the same algorithm as we change the parameters and study their effect on the agent's decisions and outcomes. We will eventually find the optimal configuration that achieves the best results for that algorithm after which we will repeat this process for the other 3 algorithms. Once we have optimized each model, we will study the effect of these models interacting with different models rather than the same. A stretch goal for this may be once again changing parameters to see which ones effect the agent's decisions and outcomes the most when playing against different policies.
